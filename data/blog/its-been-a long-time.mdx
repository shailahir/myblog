It's been a long time since I wrote any new plugin or did any new contribution on the backstage.io product.
I love working on it and its my bread and butter as well, But in last few months I was busy developing other
stuff for my day job and did not get the chance to checkout the new code in the backstage repo.

Also as you might have already noticed, I have moved the backstageio101 from wordpress. As I was not able to keep up
and the bills were high without much content. So I believe the current setup is best suited for our website.

My main goal is to share the information about this product with you, and learn it along.

Now I will try to get some information on it, as and when I get some time off. Maybe on weekends.
Stay tuned!

Thank you,
Shailendra Ahir
